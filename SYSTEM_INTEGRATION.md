2. **Push Notifications** - Require VAPID key configuration
3. **File Scanning** - Currently disabled, requires external service integration
4. **Redis Integration** - Rate limiting uses in-memory storage in development

### Recommendations for Production
1. Configure proper email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. Set up SMS service (Twilio) for urgent notifications
3. Configure push notification service
4. Set up Redis for rate limiting and caching
5. Configure monitoring and alerting (Sentry, DataDog, etc.)
6. Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
