# Quick Fix for Authentication Issue

## Problem
Users can register successfully but cannot log in because Supabase requires email confirmation by default.

## Error Message
"Email not confirmed" - Status 401

## Quick Solution (Recommended for Development)

### Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `jwxncwramclkjwngaprg`
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication â†’ Settings
4. **Find**: "User Signups" section
5. **Turn OFF**: "Enable email confirmations"
6. **Save** the settings

### Alternative: Confirm Email Manually
- Check your email inbox for the confirmation email from Supabase
- Click the confirmation link
- Then try logging in again

## What I've Added

1. **Better Error Handling**: Login now shows a clear message about email confirmation
2. **Resend Confirmation**: Added a "Resend Confirmation Email" button
3. **Improved UX**: Users get clear instructions on what to do

## Test the Fix

1. Disable email confirmation in Supabase (recommended)
2. Try logging in with your existing credentials
3. Should work immediately!

## For Production

In production, you'll want to keep email confirmation enabled for security, but for development/testing, it's easier to disable it.
